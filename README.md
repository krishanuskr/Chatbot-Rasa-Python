# Chatbot-Rasa-Python
First chatbot using Rasa and Python.

install and configure rasa, python and a text editor like vscode.

after the initial "rasa init" which generates a chatbot template, only 5 files need to be edited to customize the chatbot: endpoint.yml, domain.yml, actions.py, stories.md, and nlu.md

use "rasa train" and "rasa shell" in the commandline as needed.

Further versions/updates may include using a timezone API or a database, in place of a small dictionary currently in use.

PS: inital commit/timezonebot is the original rasa template. edits have been made in the same.
